I"Ê<p>Using the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset">Yelp dataset</a> of reviews to model the semantics and relationships between cuisines, businesses and other properties useful for restaurant recommendations.</p>

<p>The goal behind this type of modeling is to bridge the gap between the type of data that is easy to enter, track, and maintain, with the types of information users know and would like to provide search systems. That is, by having a good ontology, and the ability to reason semantically, we can provider users richer recommendations. This would be possible even when we have only a very incomplete image of their preferences.</p>
