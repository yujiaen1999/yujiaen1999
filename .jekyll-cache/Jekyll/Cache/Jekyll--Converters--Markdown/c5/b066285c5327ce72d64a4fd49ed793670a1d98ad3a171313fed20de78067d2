I"<p>Work with <a href="https://www.ee.ucla.edu/ankur-mehta/">Ankur Mehta</a>, built a demonstration platform that used wireless low-weight, low-cost sensor platforms to monitor a golf swing.</p>

<p>This contract work was for a pair of venture capitalists and was built as a technical demonstration of feasibility  tracking the inertial measurements of a golfer’s swing by using a mesh-networked set of sensors: pressure sensors in the shoe soles and inertial sensors on the hands, golf club and headband.</p>
