We developed ClearMind, a mobile application to help students overcome academic procrastination by integrating Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) principles and human-centered design. The app offers interactive, evidence-based exercises that support self-regulation and goal-directed behaviors, ensuring an engaging and personalized user experience. Our study examines the perceiveness of digital interventions in shaping student engagement and the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing academic procrastination through user studies and qualitative analysis.
